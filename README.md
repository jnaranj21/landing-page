# landing-page

My first landing-page. 
I focused on applying flex-box to align and position all the webpage sections as needed.
The structure of my webpage follows the sample given for this proyect, but I styled it in a way I think was pretty, which allowed me to reinforce the basic HTML&CSS skills I have acquired thus far.


The credits for the images I used are to:
